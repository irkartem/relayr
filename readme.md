## My question 

- Do I need use static ipâ€™s? 
- Do I need run consul agent inside DB container, for register service in good time? 
- if Ansible will register new service with checks script. Does it allow? 


## How it work 

 I have 3 docker containers. With random ips. 

 My mysql docker container starts and register service in consul via curl request (may be it's not robust way)

 Dummy apps uses env variable connect to http consul and get data:

- http://$CONSUL_PORT_8500_TCP_ADDR:8500/v1/kv/mysql_root_password?raw
- http://$CONSUL_PORT_8500_TCP_ADDR:8500/v1/health/service/mysql

## Result

It's work for me and print information from DB:

# curl localhost:8080                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
Hello world!<br>
(('Host', 254, None, 60, 60, 0, False), ('User', 254, None, 80, 80, 0, False))


But I haven't time for test and improve.

##todo
- Make domains for consul :) 
- Develop service resitration concept
- Use env for communication is not good way, may be
- Add exeption for dummyapp 
- Host port binding *:8080 work starnge. need investigate. 

## Stat.
I did not work with consul before. And do not use vagrant often.

I spent approx 6 hours for configuration. 

Main problem was my mysql docker become broken. Some mysticks and I rollback and debug it for ~3 hours.
