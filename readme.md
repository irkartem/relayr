## My question 

- Do I need use static ipâ€™s? 
- Do I need run consul agent inside DB container, for register service in good time? 
- if Ansible will register new service with checks script. Does it allow? 


## How it work 

 It will be easy with valid domains for consul. 

 I have 3 docker containers. With random ips. 

 My mysql docker container starts and register service in consul via curl request (may be it's not robust way)

 Dummy apps uses env variable connect to http consul and get data:

- http://$CONSUL_PORT_8500_TCP_ADDR:8500/v1/kv/mysql_root_password?raw
- http://$CONSUL_PORT_8500_TCP_ADDR:8500/v1/health/service/mysql
